# **Sales & Financial Performance Optimization Suite (Excel)**

---

### **Project Overview**

Engineered a dynamic **Financial Modeling Suite** in Excel to analyze Sales Variance and track **Profit & Loss (P&L) performance** against strategic targets. Moving beyond static spreadsheets, this project leverages **Advanced Excel (Power Query, Power Pivot, DAX)** and **VBA Automation** to create a scalable solution for monitoring financial health.

The goal was to transform manual, error-prone reporting into an automated system that empowers stakeholders to make data-backed adjustments to sales strategies and optimize **operational workflows**.

### **Business Problem**

The sales and finance teams were struggling with fragmented data across multiple CSV files, leading to:
*   **Operational Inefficiency:** Manual consolidation of data took hours every week, reducing time for actual analysis.
*   **Lack of Visibility:** Inability to track **Sales vs. Targets** in real-time led to missed opportunities in key markets.
*   **Static Reporting:** Standard reports lacked the flexibility to analyze P&L trends by region or product category effectively.

**Objective:** To build an automated, user-centric reporting suite that provides granular visibility into Customer Performance and Financial Metrics while reducing manual effort.

### **Strategic Business Impact**

Aligned with the goal of operational excellence, this solution delivered:

*   **Operational Efficiency (VBA Automation):** Developed VBA Macros to automate repetitive data cleaning and formatting tasks. This **reduced the manual reporting cycle time by over 90%** (slashing time from 30 mins to just 2 mins per report).
*   **Financial Performance Tracking:** Established a robust framework to monitor **Net Sales** and **Gross Margin** against quarterly targets, enabling the finance team to identify deviations early.
*   **Sales Strategy Optimization:** Created dynamic Customer Performance Reports to identify high-value clients and negotiate effective discount strategies based on historical data.

### **Technical Implementation & Automation**

This project demonstrates "Application Development" within Excel:

*   **ETL Pipeline (Power Query):** Orchestrated the Extraction, Transformation, and Loading of data from multiple sources, ensuring data consistency and automating the update process.
*   **Data Modeling (Power Pivot):** Built a relational data model within Excel to connect Sales, Customer, and Market tables, enabling complex cross-functional analysis.
*   **Advanced Analytics (DAX):** Wrote DAX measures to calculate custom KPIs like `Net Sales`, `Gross Margin %`, and `Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth`.
*   **Process Automation (VBA):** Wrote macros to handle file exports and report formatting, ensuring a seamless user experience.
